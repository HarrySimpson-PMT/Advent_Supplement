# Advent of Pico W
This year (2024) for the advent of code, I am going to attempt to solve all the problems on a pico w.

This repo is a rust workspace designed to be run on a windows machine with a dedicated linux machine that does the deployment to the pico. This is because I main a windows pc which is in my office and the pico is in the workshop. One windows machine is probably too many but this is how we got here.

There are scripts all over the place to glue things together, if you don't know anything about rust or the pico w, this repo is probably not for you. If you do know about rust and the pico w, this repo is probably still not for you. My main job consists of writing web apps in .net, I'm doing this because embedded systems are going to be a big part of the future and I want to be a part of that.
